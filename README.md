Face Recognition
Overview
The Face Recognition project is a Python-based application for facial recognition using the dlib library. This project demonstrates the capability of dlib in detecting and recognizing faces in images.

Features
Face Detection: Utilizes the dlib library to detect faces in images.
Face Recognition: Performs facial recognition using the dlib face recognition model.
Command Line Interface (CLI): Enables easy interaction through a command line interface.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/mkghgit/face_recognition.git
cd face_recognition
Install dependencies:
      **Installation**
    Setting Up Libraries
    To set up the libraries required for face recognition through Python:
    
     1. Go to the terminal and download the dlib library:
    
    pip install dlib
    
    The dlib library is a C++ toolkit that features machine learning tools and algorithms. It is important to install it to use the face_recognition library.
    
    2. Use the following command to install the face_recognition library:
    
    pip install face recognition
    
    3. Use the following command to download the OpenCV library:
    
    pip install opencv
    
    The OpenCV library will come in handy for pre-processing steps.
    
    4. Use the following commands to install other relevant libraries:
    
    import cv2
    import numpy as np
    import face_recognition as faceRegLib
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the face recognition script:

bash
Copy code
python face_recognition.py path/to/your/image.jpg
Replace path/to/your/image.jpg with the actual path to the image you want to process.

The script will output the detected faces and their corresponding recognition results.
